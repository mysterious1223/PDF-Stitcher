Instructions


To merge:

Merging will combine any supporting documents that have a Claimnumber_XX then place them into a merged folder.
All other documents will be renamed to be in the format Claimnumber_XX.pdf and also be moved to
the merged folder

PDFStitcherConsole.exe -M -F "C:\Users\ksingh\Desktop\Current Work\Newfolder\supp" 

To Append:

Append will merge the claim pdf with the corresponding supporting document pdf. This is based off of if file name MATCHES

PDFStitcherConsole.exe -k ClaimNumber_ -A -S "<supporting document>" -C "<claims>"


** I will create a bat script that will make the commandline arguments easier to use **
